# KubeTunnel

[KubeTunnel](https://dcode.tech/) helps you develop microservices locally while being connected to your Kubernetes environment.

**With KubeTunnel:**

* You run one service locally using your favorite IDE
* You run the rest of your application in Kubernetes, not limited to resources and compute power.

**This gives developers:**

* A fast local dev loop, with no waiting for a container build / push / deploy
* Ability to use their favorite local tools (IDE, debugger, etc.)
* Ability to run large-scale applications that can't run locally

## How It Works
When you select a service and a local process to tunnel, Kubetunnel launches a pod on your namespace, and changes the service to move all traffic to this pod. This pod forwards all traffic to your local proccess through a secured tunnel. The CLI then forwards all your Kubernetes services in your namespace to localhost.
This creates a two way connection between your local process and the cluster meaning:

* All other pods now connect to your local process instead of the original pod in the cluster.
* You are able to connect to other services in the namespace from the local process.
